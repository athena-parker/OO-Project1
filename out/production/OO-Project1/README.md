# Zoo Project

# Comments and Assumptions

For this project, we made assumptions about the sounds animals make. We also assumed "roll call" meant asking each animal to make their noise. We also made guesses initially of which classes to put which functions, and did have to make a few changes as we moved along.

# Issues Encountered

We did have issues with running our program on our Windows machines originally, so we switched to use IntelliJ IDEA. We also struggled a bit with syntax as neither of us has used Java before, but overall everything went smoothly. 

# Special Instructions

Only asks for an input of the day
